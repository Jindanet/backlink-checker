README

This Python script is designed to check multiple URLs for the presence of a specific string using proxies. It utilizes concurrent execution with ThreadPoolExecutor for efficient processing.

How to Use:

1. Setup:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required packages by running:
     ```
     pip install requests
     pip install fake_useragent
     ```

2. Customization:
   - Modify the `string_to_check` variable to define the string you want to search for in the URL responses.
   - Adjust the `max_workers` parameter in the ThreadPoolExecutor to control the number of concurrent threads according to your system's capabilities.
   - Customize the `headers` dictionary as needed for your requests.

3. Execution:
   - Prepare a file named `data.txt` containing the list of URLs to check, with each URL on a new line.
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```
     python script_name.py
     ```

Important Notes:

- This script uses the ProxyScrape API to fetch free HTTP proxies. Ensure you have a reliable internet connection to access the API.
- Make sure to handle the retrieved proxy list properly to avoid being blocked by the API provider.
- Adjust the timeout parameter in the `get_proxies()` function call according to your network speed and the responsiveness of the API.
